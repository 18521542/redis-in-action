# Setup
1. Create Redis instance using podman
```shell
podman run --name redis-in-action -p 6379:6379 -d redis 
# output sth like: 7e3c195ab6b91e0ac26c27380ecc4b21312fb69447d2ae91c30a875294ff7ed8
```

2. Enter Redis
```shell
podman exec -it redis-in-action sh

# Prompt to inside redis then type
redis-cli

# Now you can access to redis
127.0.0.1:6379>
```

## Problem
 In recent years, a growing number of sites have offered the ability to **vote** on:
 - web page links 
 - articles
 - or questions 
 
including sites such as reddit and Stack Overflow, as shown like below.![alt text](./resources/images/reddit-vote.png)
![alt text](./resources/images/stack-over-flow-vote.png)
By taking into consideration the votes that were cast, posts are ranked and displayed based on a score relating those votes and when the link was submitted. Weâ€™ll build a Redis-based back end for a simple version of this kind of site.
